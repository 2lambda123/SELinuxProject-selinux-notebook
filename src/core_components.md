# Core SELinux Components

**Figure 1** shows a high level diagram of the SELinux core components that
manage enforcement of the policy and comprise of the following:

1.  A [**Subjects**](subjects.md#subjects) that must be present to cause an action
    to be taken by an [**Objects**](objects.md#objects) (such as read a file as
    information only flows when a subject is involved).
2.  An Object Manager that knows the actions required of the particular
    resource (such as a file) and can enforce those actions (i.e. allow
    it to write to a file if permitted by the policy).
3.  A Security Server that makes decisions regarding the subjects rights
    to perform the requested action on the object, based on the security
    policy rules.
4.  A Security Policy that describes the rules using the SELinux
    [**Kernel Policy Language**](kernel_policy_language.md#kernel-policy-language)).
5.  An Access Vector Cache (AVC) that improves system performance by
    caching security server decisions.

Security Server are cached in the AVC to enhance performance of future

enforce the policy.*

**Figure 2** shows a more complex diagram of kernel and userspace with a number of
supporting services that are used to manage the SELinux environment.
This diagram will be referenced a number of times to explain areas of
SELinux, therefore starting from the bottom:

1.  In the current implementation of SELinux the security server is
    embedded in the kernel with the policy being loaded from userspace via a
    series of functions contained in the **libselinux** library (see
    [**SELinux Userspace Libraries**](userspace_libraries.md#selinux-userspace-libraries) for details).

    The object managers (OM) and access vector cache (AVC) can reside in:

-   **kernel space** - These object manages are for the kernel services such
as files, directory, socket, IPC etc. and are provided by hooks into the
SELinux sub-system via the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework (shown
as LSM Hooks in ) that is discussed in the
[**Linux Security Module and SELinux**](lsm_selinux.md#linux-security-module-and-selinux)
 section. The SELinux kernel AVC service is used to cache the security servers
response to the kernel based object managers thus speeding up access decisions
should the same request be asked in future.

-   **userspace** - These object managers are provided with the application
    or service that requires support for MAC and are known as
    'SELinux-aware' applications or services. Examples of these are:
    X-Windows, D-bus messaging (used by the Gnome desktop), PostgreSQL
    database, Name Service Cache Daemon (*nscd*), and the GNU / Linux passwd
    command. Generally, these OMs use the AVC services built into the
    SELinux library (libselinux), however they could, if required supply
    their own AVC or not use an AVC at all (see
    [**Implementing SELinux-aware Applications**](implementing_seaware_apps.md#implementing-selinux-aware-applications) for details).

2.  The SELinux security policy (right hand side of **Figure 2**) and its
supporting configuration files are contained in the /etc/selinux directory.
This directory contains the main SELinux configuration file *config* that has
the name of the policy to be loaded (via the *SELINUXTYPE* entry) and the initial
enforcement mode<a href="#fnc1" class="footnote-ref" id="fncor1"><sup>1</sup></a>
of the policy at load time (via the *SELINUX* entry).
The /etc/selinux/*&lt;SELINUXTYPE&gt;* directories
contain policies that can be activated along with their configuration
files (e.g. '*SELINUXTYPE=targeted*' will have its policy and associated
configuration files located at */etc/selinux/targeted*). All known
configuration files are shown in the
[**SELinux Configuration Files**](configuration_files.md#selinux-configuration-files)
sections.

3.  SELinux supports a 'modular policy', this means that a policy does not
have to be one large source policy but can be built from modules. A
modular policy consists of a base policy that contains the mandatory
information (such as object classes, permissions etc.), and zero or more
policy modules where generally each supports a particular application or
service. These modules are compiled, linked, and held in a 'policy
store' where they can be built into a binary format that is then loaded
into the security server (in the diagram the binary policy is located at
*/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.30*). The types of policy and their
construction are covered in the
[**Types of SELinux Policy**](types_of_policy.md#types-of-selinux-policy)
section.

4.  To be able to build the policy in the first place, policy source is
required (top left hand side of **Figure 2**). This can be supplied in three
basic ways:

-  as source code written using the
[**Kernel Policy Language**](kernel_policy_language.md#kernel-policy-language),
however it is not recommended for large policy developments.
-  using the **Reference Policy** that has high
level macros to define policy rules. This is the standard way
policies are now built for SELinux distributions such as Red Hat
and Debian and is discussed in the
[**The Reference Policy**](reference_policy.md#the-reference-policy)
section. Note that SE for Android also uses high level macros to define
policy rules.
-  using CIL (Common Intermediate Language). An overview can be found
in the [**CIL Policy Language**](cil_overview.md#cil-overview)
section. The <https://github.com/DefenSec/dssp> is a good example.

5. To be able to compile and link the policy source then load it into the
security server requires a number of tools (top of **Figure 2**).

6.  To enable system administrators to manage policy, the SELinux
environment and label file systems, tools and modified GNU / Linux
commands are used. These are mentioned throughout the Notebook as needed
and summarised in
[**SELinux Commands**](selinux_cmds.md#appendix-c---selinux-commands).
Note that there are many other applications to manage policy, however this
Notebook only concentrates on the core services.

7.  To ensure security events are logged, GNU / Linux has an audit service
that captures policy violations. The
[**Auditing Events**](auditing.md#auditing-selinux-events)
section describes the format of these security events.

8.  SELinux supports network services that are described in the
[**SELinux Networking Support**](network_support.md#selinux-networking-support)
section.

The [**Linux Security Module and SELinux**](lsm_selinux.md#linux-security-module-and-selinux)
section goes into greater detail of the LSM / SELinux modules with a walk
through of a ***fork**(2)* and ***exec**(2)* process.

<li id="fnc1"><p>When SELinux is enabled, the policy can be running in 'permissive mode' (<code>SELINUX=permissive</code>), where all accesses are allowed. The policy
can also be run in 'enforcing mode' (<code>SELINUX=enforcing</code>), where any
access that is not defined in the policy is denied and an entry placed
in the audit log. SELinux can also be disabled (at boot time only) by
setting <code>SELINUX=disabled</code>. There is also support for the
<a href="type_statements.md#permissive"><code>permissive</code></a>
statement that allows a domain to run in permissive mode while the others are still confined
(instead of the all or nothing set by <code>SELINUX=</code>).<a href="#fncor1" class="footnote-back">â†©</a></p></li>
