# SELinux Notebook Examples

This area contains the following directories:

***network*** - Contains CIPSO, CALIPSO and IPSEC examples.

***selinux-policy*** - Contains info to build simple kernel and CIL policy.

***sepgsql*** - Contains SE-PostgreSQL database example.

**NOTE:** To run the majority of these examples requires root privilege,
therefore need to su etc. (or just log on as root and be damned)
